Author Thomas Jansen 11008938

A Trivia App. You will be asked 5 very diffcult random questions from Jservice.io. 
You'll get 3 tries for every question, but retrying will cost you 10 points. 
You can ask for a hint as well, but that will cost you 100 points.
How many points you get, depends on the difficulty of the question.

After 5 questions you'll be shown the leader board with high scores.
